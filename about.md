  I, Shivang Tripathi, am second year student of Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College pursuing my Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics engineering. Hailing from the city of Nawabs(Lucknow) , I like learning and exploring into the unknown for anything and everything. I often find myself interested in anything which is even remotely connected to computing systems(Both hardware and software end)

 Currently recruited in the prestigious department of AKGEC,ie, <em>Software Incubator</em>, I plan to learn loads of new stuff everyday like <a href="mario/index.html">this mario</a>(still developing) from seniors and peers.
