        <p>Learn by doing things. True learning can never be achieved in the captivation of the four walls of a classroom. Classroom teaching provides no hurdles to the learning process. Without any obstruction, there is no significant excitation of the parts of brain responsible for learning. Thus the student gets a false sense of learning. True learning can be achieved only by doing or making a product pertaining  to the concepts you are learning.</p>
<p>This provides many challenges to the objective which the learner wants to achieve. In the process of overcoming this hurdle, significant part of the brain is activated leading to learning as well as long-term skill retention.
