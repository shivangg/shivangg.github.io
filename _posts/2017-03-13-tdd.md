##  Intro to TDD: Test Driven Development

Finally, I was at a point in life where the only way forward was through writing (and then passing) the tests for the development. Two minutes into this thing
and I was thinking how was I even living without this magical superpower. 
Python was what I was writing my Conway's Game of Life in. Finally, I had to write tests to see if the cells of the world were following the rules of the 0 player game. 
`unittest` or `doctest`? And what is that nose thing? 

### 1. Write tests(RED):
	
Without writing a single line of code, get sorted about what will you be building. What objective will it try to accomplish? For different inputs, what should be the output. Write it down and you down with half the journey. Now, just use the `doctest` syntax to put down these i/p and o/p for the test file. Running these will fail the tests(because you have not written any code yet!)

### 2. Write development Code(GREEN):
Write the bare minimum to convert your failing (red) tests into passing ones (green). 

### 3. Refactor Code
Convert your bare minimum into easily understandable (by you and others) code. 


	Go-Karts - Feel fast, are slow

	747s - Feel slow, are fast


	“Ship it!” - Feels fast, is slow

	“Test + Document it!” - Feels slow, is fast.
