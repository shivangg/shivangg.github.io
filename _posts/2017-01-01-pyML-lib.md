## Install ML python libraries Pycharm

After some tinkering, I wasa finally able to pull this through. Maybe this is not the best way but this works for me. Steps : 

* Install Miniconda 3 using the miniconda3 executible for Windows.
* Go to File => Settings => Project.
* In the Project Interpreter box, give the path to the `python.exe` in the folder where miniconda is installed.
* Then run pip install *package*
* To run the python program do not use the console. Use the Run (`Ctrl+Shift+F10`)

	This should work after PyCharm indexes the files after some seconds.
