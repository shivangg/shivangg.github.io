## Finally understanding the beauty of the Dockers 

They always were the magical power that everyone seemed to be using but I could never get my head around it. But I had foolishly been trying to learn it as they were used in the open source projects rather than simple tutorials. The straight simple tutorials, I could've just asked! 
So, as I suspected they are a beautifully *simplified* way to set up virtual environments for: 

* Making sure the software does not break under the standard intended environment due to unmet dependencies.

* Reproducing the bugs to fix.

The virtual environments are made from *images* and are called the *containers*. They use the same single host OS rather each virtual environment being a separate OS itself leading to :

1. Smaller size

2. Faster access

### Dockerfile
*Dockerfile*s are ways to generate a brand new customized image to create *container*. The *Dockerfile*s are set of commands in the text file to customize the base-images as intended.

Dockerfile => image => container 


### Volumes 
While working with the data in containers, it can be copied using the 
1. `docker container cp` command
2. Putting the COPY instruction in the `Dockerfile`.
 
But the data is not persistent. Any changes in these files  will be not seen in the container.
Solution is the Docker `*volume*`
