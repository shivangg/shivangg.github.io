##ETHOS

Learn by doing things. **True learning** can never be achieved in the captivation of the four walls of a classroom. Classroom teaching provides no hurdles to the learning process. Without any obstruction, there is no significant excitation of the parts of brain responsible for learning. Thus the student gets a false sense of learning. True learning can be achieved only by doing or making a product pertaining  to the concepts you are learning.
